## Credit Resampling

1) Given the results generated, the naive random oversampling produced the highest balanced accuracy score of the three.
2) Given my results, I also have the naive random oversampling producing the best recall score.
3) In my results, I also have the naive random oversampling producing the best geometric mean. I am unsure of where my error may lie, but I believe, given what I learned in this series of lectures, that my numbers were compromised and generated inaccurate scores on all three counts. Unfortunately, I am unsure as to why this occurred.

## Credit Risk Ensemble
1) In my results, the easy ensemble had the best recall score at .94 
2) Again, the easy ensemble considerably outperformed the balanced random forrest method in geometric mean, also.
3)The top three features are:

Loan Amount
Interest Rate
